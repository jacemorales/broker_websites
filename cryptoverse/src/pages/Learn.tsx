            <h2>What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
            <p>A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers.</p>

            <h2>What is a Blockchain?</h2>
            <p>A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked together using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. This makes it resistant to modification of its data.</p>
